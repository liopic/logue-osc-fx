# logue-sdk oscillators and effects

Custom oscillators and effects for Korg NTS-1, minilogue xd, prologue and other logue-sdk based synths.

## Effects

### Hungry Driven

[Download the file](https://github.com/liopic/logue-osc-fx/raw/main/hungry_driven.ntkdigunit)

This mod effect is a __Parabolic Soft-clipping Overdrive__ that applies a light punch
to your sounds. But in order to make the effect bolder, it can feedback itself up to 10
times, like having 10 FX pedals connected in series. The effect result ranges from a
subtle colouring to a harsh distortion!

* Param A - Time : Controls how many overdrive pedals are chained, from 1 (left) to 10 (right).
* Param B - Depth : Controls dry:wet fx factor, from dry (left) to wet (right).

Suggestions: For some light punch, use param A at 1/4 and param B at 3/4. For a great
overdrive, set param A to 3/4 and param B to 1/4 and turn it right slowly, but beware your
speakers and ears!

## General installation instructions

Get the .ntkdigunit file and install it using Korg's Librarian into your device. Despite
it's optimized for NTS-1, it should work in all other Korg devices (let me know if not).

## Donations

If you want me to continue working on these, just [donate](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/liopic)
so I can eventually buy a __minilogue-xd__ (I only own a __NTS-1__).

## Development instructions

Look in the README.md of each directory.

# logue-sdk oscillators and effects

Custom oscillators and effects for Korg NTS-1, minilogue xd, prologue and other logue-sdk based synths.

## Effects

### Hungry Driven

[Download the file](https://github.com/liopic/logue-osc-fx/raw/main/hungry_driven.ntkdigunit)

This mod effect is a __Parabolic Soft-clipping Overdrive__ that can improve your sounds,
from a subtle colouring to a clear distortion. It can feedback itself up to 4 times: it's
like having 4 overdrive pedals connected in series!

* Param A - Time : Controls how many overdrive pedals are chained, from 1 (left) to 4 (right).
* Param B - Depth : Controls dry:wet fx factor, from dry (left) to wet (right).

Suggestions: For some light punch, use param A full-left and param B at 3/4. For a great
overdrive, set param A to 3/4 and param B to 1/4 and turn it right slowly, but beware your
speakers and ears!

## General installation instructions

Get the .ntkdigunit file and install it using Korg's Librarian into your device. Despite
it's optimized for NTS-1, it should work in all other Korg devices (let me know if not).

## Donations

If you want me to continue working on these, just [donate](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/liopic)
so I can eventually buy a __minilogue-xd__ (I only own a __NTS-1__).

## Development instructions

Look in the README.md of each directory.
